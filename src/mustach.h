/**
 * mustach_itf - interface for callbacks
 *
 * All of this function should return a negative value to stop
 * the mustache processing. The returned negative value will be
 * then returned to the caller of mustach as is.
 *
 * The functions enter and next should return 0 or 1.
 *
 * All other functions should normally return 0.
 *
 * @start: Starts the mustach processing of the closure
 *
 * @put: Writes the value of 'name' to 'file' with 'escape' or not
 *
 * @enter: Enters the section of 'name' if possible.
 *         Musts return 1 if entered or 0 if not entered.
 *         When 1 is returned, the function 'leave' will always be called.
 *         Conversely 'leave' is never called when enter returns 0 or
 *         a negative value.
 *         When 1 is returned, the function must activate the first
 *         item of the section.
 *
 * @next: Activates the next item of the section if it exists.
 *        Musts return 1 when the next item is activated.
 *        Musts return 0 when there is no item to activate.
 *
 * @leave: Leaves the last entered section
 *
 * @partial: Returns an allocated string for the partial content for 'name'.
 *           The returned string (in 'result') will be freed by mustach
 *           'partial' is optional, it cans be NULL.
